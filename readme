# RELEASE_CppPolygons
An attetmpt to make the release version of CppPolygons tool that might be used in 
different tasks.

# Usage
./MC_exfoliation settings_fname

# Settings
Lx [Ly, Lz] - lengths of the parallelepiped cell (float)
thickness - thickness of the disk-shaped filler (float)
shell_thickness - additional thickness of the disk-shaped interface from every 
    side, so complete thickness of the interface disk equals to the sum of 
    thickness and 2 * shell_thickness (float)
outer_radius - radius of the outer circumference of the disk's base polygon (float)
vertices_number - number of vertices in the regular polygon that is base for the 
    cylinder/disk (int)
disks_number - desired number of fillers in the system; real number can be the 
    same or less (int)
max_attempts - maximum attempts number in the Monte-Carlo algorithm part (int)
mixing_steps - maximum number of mixing steps in the mixing algorithm part, only 
    successive step count, so may strongly influence on the calculation time (int)
LOG - name of the log file (std::string)
shape - shape of filler particles (and consequently interface), is made for future 
    versions (enum<std::string>('pc'))
    pc - PolygonalCylinder

Required for the mixed algorithm:
    Lx, thickness, shell_thickness, outer_radius, vertices_number, disks_number,
    LOG, mixing_steps, shape
Required for the mc algorithm:
    Lx, thickness, shell_thickness, outer_radius, vertices_number, disks_number, 
    LOG, max_attempts, shape
